**About the Evolution of Diabetes over the years from 1980 to 2014**

The dataset on global diabetes, sourced from https://ncdrisc.org/data-downloads-diabetes.html, has been meticulously curated. To provide a comprehensive overview of diabetes prevalence across countries globally and genders(men and/or women) from 1980 to 2014, age-standardized data was utilized. The focus is on discerning the percentage of individuals afflicted by diabetes across various age groups, with a breakdown by gender.

**Target Groups:**

*Researchers and Public Health Professionals*: To analyze and derive insights into diabetes trends globally, aiding in the formulation of targeted health policies.

*Healthcare Providers*: Enabling them to understand the age and gender-specific diabetes prevalence in different countries, facilitating better patient care and resource allocation.

**Use Cases:**

*Epidemiological Studies*: Researchers can conduct comprehensive studies to identify patterns, risk factors, and interventions based on age, gender, and geographical location.

*Policy Formulation*: Governments and health organizations can make informed decisions on resource allocation and policy development by understanding diabetes prevalence in specific demographic groups.

*Health Education Campaigns*: Tailored awareness campaigns can be designed to target specific age groups and genders where diabetes rates are high, fostering preventive measures and early detection.

**Type of Visualization Used:**

*Bar Chart*: The chosen visualization type is a Bar Chart, providing an intuitive representation of diabetes percentages across different countries, genders, and age groups over the specified years.

**Additional features and their benefits:**

*Customization through Filtering*: Users have the flexibility to customize results based on specific criteria such as country, gender, and year, tailoring the analysis to their specific needs.

*Hovering Feature*: The hovering feature allows users to obtain detailed information by simply hovering over the bars, displaying the name of the country and the corresponding diabetes percentages for different age groups and genders in specific years.

**How to Use:**

*Clone Repository*: Users can clone the GitHub repository to access the visualization.

*Run in GitHub Codespaces*: To run the project in the CodeSpace, the user needs to replace the placeholder URLs (**const countriesApiUrl** and **const yearApiUrl**) with the appropriate URLs for the CodeSpace environment.
